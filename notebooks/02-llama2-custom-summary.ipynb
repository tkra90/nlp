Instead of using precise float point 32 or 16 formats, weights are categorized into \"bins\" by their values. These bins can then be represented in more straightforward formats like int/float4 or int/float8 - a technique known as Quantization, often dubbed normal float 4 or 8. An added layer, double quantization, further refines these bins to conserve memory. Although the weights get quantized, during back-propagation, we revert them to float 16 to update. Post-update, these specific values are discarded.\n","\n","- **[Bits and Bytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes)**: Excellent package by Tim Dettmers et al., which provides a lightweight

The theory posits that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another, and that time and space are relative rather than absolute. In other words, time can appear to slow down or speed up depending on an observer's motion and position, and the length of an object can increase or decrease depending on its speed relative to an observer. The theory of relativity has far-reaching implications, including the idea that the passage of time is relative, that time dilation occurs when objects move at high speeds, and that space and time are intertwined as a single entity called spacetime. The theory has been experimentally verified through numerous observations and experiments, and has led to a greater understanding of the nature of space and time in the universe.\n","CPU times: user 13.6 s, sys: 324 ms, total: 13.9 s\n","Wall time: 15.8 s\n"]}],"source":["%%time\n","\n","tkn = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(modelx)\n","tkn.pad_token = tkn.eos_token\n","\n","prompt_to_test = 'Prompt: What is the theory of relativity?

The theory posits that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another, and that the passage of time and the length of objects can vary depending on their speed and position in a gravitational field. The theory consists of two main parts: special relativity, which deals with objects moving at constant speeds relative to each other, and general relativity, which deals with gravity and its effects on spacetime. Special relativity introduces the concept of time dilation, where time appears to pass more slowly for an observer in motion relative to a stationary observer, and length contraction, where objects appear shorter to an observer in motion relative to them. General relativity introduces the concept of gravitational redshift, where light is affected by the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence\n","CPU times: user 14.6 s, sys: 1.88 ms, total: 14.6 s\n","Wall time: 14.6 s\n"]}],"source":["%%time\n","\n","device = torch.device(\"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n","print(device)\n","\n","encoding = tkn(prompt_to_test, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(device)\n","with torch.no_grad():\n","    outputs = qmodel.generate(\n","        input_ids = encoding.input_ids,\n","        attention_mask = encoding.attention_mask,\n","        generation_config = generation_config\n","    )\n","\n","print(tkn.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["***\n","### Build Dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-24T16:45:21.440447Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-24T16:45:21.440060Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-24T16:45:53.423438Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-24T16:45:53.422308Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-24T16:45:21.440417Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["train_df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/newspaper-text-summarization-cnn-dailymail/cnn_dailymail/train.csv\")\n","test_df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/newspaper-text-summarization-cnn-dailymail/cnn_dailymail/test.csv\")\n","val_df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/newspaper-text-summarization-cnn-dailymail/cnn_dailymail/validation.csv\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-24T16:45:53.426176Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-24T16:45:53.425415Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-24T16:45:53.597529Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-24T16:45:53.596611Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-24T16:45:53.426139Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 311971 entries, 0 to 311970\n","Data columns (total 3 columns):\n"," #   Column      Non-Null Count   Dtype \n","---  ------      --------------   ----- \n"," 0   id          311971 non-null  object\n"," 1   article     311971 non-null  object\n"," 2   highlights  311971 non-null  object\n","dtypes: object(3)\n","memory usage: 7.1+ MB\n"]}],"source":["df = pd.concat([train_df, test_df, val_df],ignore_index=True) # concating them\n","# del train_df, test_df, val_df # del the rest for memory space\n","df.info()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-24T16:45:53.598865Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-24T16:45:53.598579Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-24T16:45:53.608273Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-24T16:45:53.607301Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-24T16:45:53.598820Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["DEFAULT_PROMPT = \"Below is a snippet from a newspaper article.

Although frost is set to hit the south tonight - with temperatures dropping to 1C - Britons stocking up for a barbecue will be in luck tomorrow, with forecasters predicting dry and sunny weather across southern England, southern Wales and the south Midlands.
